🍦 Ice Cream Revenue Prediction Project
📝 Overview
This project is a simple machine learning application that builds a Linear Regression model to predict ice cream sales revenue based on temperature. The Ice Cream.csv dataset was used for this purpose.

🎯 Goals & Features
Loading and processing data using the Pandas library.

Splitting the data into training and testing sets using Scikit-learn.

Building and training a simple linear regression model to understand the relationship between variables.

Visualizing the model's performance and results using Matplotlib.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

🚀 How to Run
Ensure you have Python and the libraries listed above installed.

Download the ice_cream_prediction.ipynb notebook and the Ice Cream.csv data file.

Make sure both files are in the same directory.

📊 Results
The model demonstrates a strong, positive linear relationship between temperature and revenue. The plots show that the model performed excellently on both the training and test data, indicating its ability to predict accurately.
